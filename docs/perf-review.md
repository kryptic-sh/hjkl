# Performance Review

**Project:** hjkl (terminal text editor)
**Date:** 2026-07-23
**Scope:** entire codebase
**Verdict:** The codebase is well-optimized for a terminal editor. Two hotspots
stand out: the syntax highlighter's per-capture string clones and the motion
system's per-character line allocations. Below, ranked by impact.

---

## Findings

### 🔴 P1 — Per-capture `String` clone in highlight inner loop

**`crates/hjkl-bonsai/src/highlighter.rs:892`** — `capture_names[capture.index as usize].clone()`

Inside the hottest loop in the codebase (every tree-sitter match × every capture
within the match), each capture clones its name as a `String`. The
`HighlightSpan.capture` field (line 54) is typed `String`, forcing every span to
own a copy. For a 10k-token file, this produces ~10k `String` allocations per
highlight pass — per keystroke.

The `capture_names` `Vec<String>` is borrowed from `self.compiled` and outlives
the loop. The clone is unnecessary for any consumer that only needs `&str`.

**Fix:** Change `HighlightSpan.capture: String` to either (a) a `u32` index
into `capture_names`, or (b) `Arc<str>` shared from the compiled artifacts.
Either eliminates the per-span allocation. The index approach also avoids the
`iter().position()` scan at line 868.

### 🔴 P2 — `read_line` clones entire line per character during word motions

**`crates/hjkl-engine/src/motions.rs:69,941-942`**

`char_at` calls `read_line_opt(buf, pos.row)` which returns `Option<String>` — a
full `String` clone of the line from the rope, via `Query::line`. Inside word
motion loops (`next_word_start:958`, `next_word_end:1100`), `char_at` is called
once per character examined. Scanning 200 chars across word boundaries means 200
full-line `String` allocations.

A 10k-char line scanned by `w`/`b`/`e` allocates 10k copies of that line's text.

**Fix:** Add a `char_at` variant (or change `read_line_opt`) that returns `&str`
by borrowing from the rope, avoiding the `String` allocation. The `Query::line`
→ `String` path forces the allocation; use `rope_line_str` (which returns
`String`) only once per row, or provide a rope reference that avoids the copy.

---

### 🔴 P3 — `is_keyword_char` re-parses `iskeyword` spec on every call

**`crates/hjkl-buffer/src/motion.rs:20-51`**

`is_keyword_char(c, spec)` calls `spec.split(',')` on every invocation — it
parses the `iskeyword` option string (e.g. `"@,48-57,_,192-255"`) from scratch
per character. Called from `char_kind` → `is_word` during every `w`/`b`/`e`/`ge`
character step. 200 chars × 4 tokens = 800 `split` iterations per word motion.

The spec never changes during editing; it's an option set once at startup.

**Fix:** Pre-parse the spec into a `Vec<Token>` (or `fn(char) -> bool` closure)
once when the option is set. Callers then use the pre-parsed form.

---

### 🟠 P4 — `format!` allocations on every render frame (statusline)

**`apps/hjkl/src/render.rs:150,158,161,183,188,220-236,243,326`**

The statusline is rendered every frame (~60 fps) and contains 8+ `format!`
calls, each allocating a temporary `String`. The diagnostic-count block (lines
204–237) does 4 separate `.filter().count()` passes over `lsp_diags` plus up to
5 `format!` allocations — all on data that changes only on LSP notifications
(rare).

The filename `to_owned()` at line 149, the position/percentage `format!` at
lines 158/161, and the loading-label `format!` at line 326 all run
unconditionally.

**Fix:** Pre-compute and memoize diag counts, invalidating on LSP change.
Replace filename clone with `Cow<str>`. Accumulate statusline parts into a
single `String` with `clear()` + `write!` (or `push_str`) instead of
per-segment `format!`.

### 🟠 P5 — `Vec::contains` linear scan in highlight cache eviction

**`crates/hjkl-bonsai/src/highlighter.rs:212,216`**

`evict_stale` operates on `cache_langs: Vec<String>` and `cache_hashes: Vec<u64>`
built at lines 1118–1119. The retain closures do:
- `keep_langs.iter().any(|kk| kk == k)` — O(|map| × |keep_langs|) per pass
- `keep_hashes.contains(h)` — O(|hashes| × |keep_hashes|) per pass

For documents with many injection blocks, both become quadratic. Build
`cache_langs` and `cache_hashes` as `HashSet` instead of `Vec` for O(1) lookup.
The `map` and `collect` at line 1118 can be replaced by `HashSet::from_iter`.

---

### 🟠 P6 — `capture_names.iter().position()` O(n) scan in nested match loop

**`crates/hjkl-bonsai/src/highlighter.rs:868`**

For each match that has pre-extracted directives, this scans the capture-names
Vec to find the index matching a capture name. Capture names are small (~10–50),
but this is inside a loop that already iterates all matches × all pre_extracted
directives.

**Fix:** Pre-build a `HashMap<&str, u32>` from name → capture index once at
compile time. Reuse across all matches. Eliminated entirely if P1 switches
capture names to indices.

---

### 🟡 P7 — Render-time `row_search_ranges` re-runs regex per visible line

**`crates/hjkl-buffer-tui/src/render.rs:1068-1072`**

Every frame with an active search runs `search_match_ranges(re, line)` on each
visible line. The engine's `SearchState` (`crates/hjkl-engine/src/search.rs`)
already caches per-row byte ranges keyed by `dirty_gen`. The renderer
independently re-does the regex work per frame, bypassing the cache.

**Fix:** Consult `SearchState::matches_for(row)` instead of calling
`search_match_ranges` directly. Cache gives O(1) lookup on hit, O(regex_scan) on
miss.

---

### 🟡 P8 — `lines_prefetch: Vec<String>` allocates every frame

**`crates/hjkl-buffer-tui/src/render.rs:483-485`**

Every frame allocates a `Vec<String>` of `area.height` (~50) cloned `String`s
from the rope. Used to feed `Cow::Borrowed` accessors during the render walk
loop, which avoids further per-line clones. This is a deliberate tradeoff
(documentation at line 491: "Avoids a String clone per visible row") and 50
allocations per frame is acceptable, but worth noting.

**Fix:** Could be avoided with a `rope.slice()` that returns borrowed data, or a
lightweight line-buffer struct reused across frames. Low priority — the 50-line
allocation is cheap compared to the highlight work.

---

### 🟡 P9 — `which_key` `pending.clone()` + `Chord` allocation per frame

**`apps/hjkl/src/render.rs:3020`** — `hjkl_keymap::Chord(pending.clone()).to_notation(leader)`

When the which-key popup is visible, each frame clones the pending key Vec and
formats it to a notation string. The pending keys change only on keypress, not
every frame.

**Fix:** Cache the formatted header string, invalidate on prefix change.

---

### ⚪ P10 — `HighlightSpan.metadata: HashMap<String, MetaValue>` per span

**`crates/hjkl-bonsai/src/highlighter.rs:57,897-910`**

Every `HighlightSpan` carries a `HashMap`. The empty-map path is short-circuited
at line 897–910 (common case returns `HashMap::new()`, which is zero-alloc until
first insert) — good. Spans WITH metadata (from `#set!` directives, rare in
practice) allocate per span. Directives are typically only present in injection
patterns.

**Fix:** Low priority. Could use `Box<HashMap<…>>` or `Option` to save 48 bytes
per span in the common no-metadata case.

---

### ⚪ P11 — `Range<usize>.clone()` — Range is Copy (cosmetic)

**`crates/hjkl-bonsai/src/highlighter.rs:752,1125,1140,1171`**

`Range<usize>` implements `Copy`. The `.clone()` calls compile to identical code
but signal a misunderstanding. No runtime cost — cosmetic only.

---

## Data Structure Audit

| Location | Current | Issue | Fix |
|----------|---------|-------|-----|
| `highlighter.rs:54` | `capture: String` | Per-span alloc | `u32` index or `Arc<str>` |
| `highlighter.rs:1118` | `cache_langs: Vec<String>` | O(n) `.any()` in retain | `HashSet<String>` |
| `highlighter.rs:1119` | `cache_hashes: Vec<u64>` | O(n) `.contains()` in retain | `HashSet<u64>` |
| `highlighter.rs:357` | `AHashMap<u64, Arc<…>>` | Good — fast hasher | — |
| `highlighter.rs:163,176` | Nested `HashMap` for cache | Good — O(1) | — |
| `motion.rs:20` | `spec.split(',')` per call | Re-parsed per char | Pre-parse once |

## Positive Findings

- **`ChildCache` eviction** correctly prunes to current working set only.
- **`SearchState`** caches per-row byte ranges with `dirty_gen` invalidation.
- **`COMPILED_CACHE`** global `ahash::AHashMap` avoids re-parsing queries.
- **`sync_after_engine_mutation`** compares `(buffer, top_row, height, dirty_gen)` to skip redundant recompute.
- **`folds_override`** uses `saturating_add(1)` to avoid wrapping.
- **Renderer `line_at`** returns `Cow::Borrowed` for prefetched rows, avoiding per-cell cloning.
- **Tree-sitter `parse_timeout_micros`** bounds parse work on huge files.
- **`parse_incremental`** skipped `changed_ranges` call that was 54% of per-keystroke CPU on huge files.
- **Swap file I/O** uses `O_EXCL` + `create_new(true)` and explicit fsync.
- **Subprocess lifecycle** properly timed out, killed, and waited.
